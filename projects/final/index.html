            <h1>What genre of music is most effective in helping you study?</h1>
            <h2>It is well known now that music can be beneficial for studying. But, as finals season looms, lets find out what the most and least effective genres are.</h2>

            <p>If you walked into a college library during finals season, you would most likely encounter rows of students hunched over, engrossed in their laptops and notebooks, with headphones resting over their ears.</p>
            <p>Students have long been using music as an instrument to study and be productive ever since streaming music became widely accessible, but while it’s well established that music can enhance focus and productivity, the effectiveness varies widely. So what is the best soundtrack for studying, and which genres might actually be working against you?</p>
            <p>For many, the answer is predictably classical music. <a
                href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278406769_The_Baroque_music's_influence_on_learning_efficiency_based_on_the_research_of_brain_cognition">Decades of research</a> have pointed to classical music, particularly from the Baroque era, as a powerful tool for cognitive enhancement. Known for its structured rhythms and harmonic predictability, classical music can create a mental environment conducive to focus and comprehension. A <a
                href="https://scholarcommons.sc.edu/scurs/2022symposium/2022posters/35/">University of South Carolina study</a> found that classical music helped participants absorb unfamiliar material more effectively, largely because it lacks the lyrical distractions that other genres contain.</p>
                
            
                        <p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7JmprpRIsEY?si=uiuOipWf9YFSHJXw&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
                        
                
                <p>In recent years, however, classical music has found competition from a more modern, internet-native genre: lo-fi. Short for “low fidelity,” lo-fi hip-hop is characterized by mellow beats, repetitive rhythms, and often ambient sounds like rain, vinyl crackles, or soft instrumentals. Streaming platforms like YouTube and Spotify now feature endless lo-fi playlists designed for studying, some with tens of millions of plays. According to a study published in the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354899901_Effects_of_Three_Genres_of_Focus_Music_on_Heart_Rate_Variability_and_Sustained_Attention">Journal of Cognitive enhancement</a>, lo-fi music along with instrumental jazz and soft piano can increase sustained attention and reduce anxiety, making it especially popular among younger students.</p>
                
                <p><iframe title="Songs across 100 Spotify study/focus playlists" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-px5tq" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/px5tq/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="488" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}}))}();</script></p>

                <p>“I listen to instrumentals,” said Jane DeLashmutt, a senior English major. “Low-fi, atmospheric music, oh and movie scores. I love a good movie score” Since most of her studying is in the form of reading, DeLashmutt typically listens to music for a background noise cancelling effect, meaning without lyrics or lower tempo. And she's not the only one.</p>

                    </div>   

                <p>“My friends listen to pop music, like exciting stuff,” said DeLashmutt. “And I tried to do that sometimes, but instead I just get too excited to focus.”</p>

                <p>Music with lyrics, as most pop, rock, and rap songs often do, prove less effective for studying. Lyrics can interfere with tasks involving reading or writing, as the brain struggles to process both verbal streams simultaneously. High-energy genres with unpredictable shifts in tempo and tone can also fragment attention, especially during mentally intensive tasks.</p>

                <p>A <a href="https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/western-texas-college/english-literature/effects-of-music-genre-on-exam-performance-a-psyc-3400-pilot-study/123397010">student survey</a> conducted at Kwantlen Polytechnic University found that lyrical music significantly reduced students’ reading comprehension scores, especially among those unfamiliar with the material. However, the same study noted that students accustomed to studying with music were less negatively affected.</p>

                <p>So, the next time you sit down to study, don’t just hit shuffle. Don't just play any old Boiler Room set while applying to jobs. Be mindful about your soundtrack, and choose music that truly supports your goals.</p>
